# Python Alarm
Small app developed by me using python and a LAMP Server to program alarms, with capability to cut, put effects and etc.

The software runs basically over a small python script that runs every minute to check if there is any song to start and play it with configurations made in the backend.

The backend consists in a simple PHP CRUD made by hand to make it as simple as possible.

The backend uses Bootstrap 5, but it will be more polished.

Simple functions tested with DB and working:
    - Add and Upload songs in MP3.
    - Create and include in database the Alarm.

Tools:
    - TestAlarm.py - Used to list the alarms and select one to execute and check sound.

Future releases
    - Remove song from DB and Server
    - Edit Alarm
    - Remove Alarm
    - Create users
    - Polish the UI/UX
    - Improve login and security

If you want to use, please, contact me. It consumes time and health.

Thanks for visiting my small project :)
