# Python Alarm
Small app developed by me using python and a mysql database to program alarms, with capability to cut, put effects and etc.

The software runs basically over a small python script that runs every minute to check if there is any song to start and play it with configurations made in the backend.

The backend consists in a simple PHP CRUD made by hand to make it as simple as possible.

There is no css or layout applied to the system yet.

Simple functions tested with DB and working:
    - Add and Upload songs in MP3.
    - Create and include in database the Alarm.

Future releases
    - Remove song from DB and Server
    - Edit Alarm
    - Remove Alarm
    - Create users
    - Add bootstrap to the backend

If you want to use, please, contact me. It consumes time and health.

Thanks for visiting my small project :)
