# Python Alarm
Small app developed by me using python and a LAMP Server to program alarms, with capability to cut, put effects and etc.

The software runs basically over a small python script that runs every minute to check if there is any song to start and play it with configurations made in the backend.

The backend consists in a simple PHP CRUD made by hand to make it as simple as possible.

The backend uses Bootstrap 5, but it will be more polished.

Functions of the system working right now:
    - Upload songs in MP3.
    - List alarms
    - Delete songs
    - Create and include alarms.

Tools:
    - tool_testAlarm.py - Used to list the alarms and select one to execute and check sound.
    - tool_testDB.py - Used to check if the DB credentials are working.
    - tool_testLog.py - Used to test how to make logs with Python.
    - tool_uploadDebug.html - Used to test if Apache and PHP configuration is working as expected.

Future releases
    - Edit Alarm
    - Remove Alarm
    - Create users
    - Polish the UI/UX
    - Improve login and security
    - Improve checking and mysql inclusions
